# SafeChat ðŸ’¬
SafeChat is a open-source and secure chat app that prioritizes security in every aspect. It's easy to use and provides a platform for the secure exchange of confidential data.

## **What it does**
SafeChat provides a secure and user-friendly chat platform that protects user privacy and confidentiality. It is designed to keep user data secure at all times, and all communications are encrypted using the latest security protocols.

With SafeChat, users can easily exchange messages, share files, and communicate with each other in a safe and secure environment. The app's intuitive interface makes it easy to use, and its robust security features give users peace of mind knowing that their data is always protected.

## **How I built it**
I built SafeChat's frontend using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The HTML provided the basic structure for the app, while CSS was used to style the app's interface. jQuery was used to create interactive elements and make the app more user-friendly.

For the backend, I used Express.js to create the server. Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to build web applications. It provides a range of features that simplify the process of building and managing web applications.

To handle data transmission, I used Socket.io. Socket.io is a library that makes it easy to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client. It's ideal for building chat apps because it allows messages to be transmitted instantly, without the need for refreshing the page.

Overall, SafeChat was built using a combination of powerful frontend and backend technologies that work together to create a secure and user-friendly chat app.
